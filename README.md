# Objectivity in the Modern Newsroom
This is the Github repo for the SRCCON Session _Objectivity in the Modern Newsroom, or journalists and identity in a climate of polarization, mockery and hate_.

### Description
For decades, journalists have adhered to ethical codes of conduct that prevented them from taking political stances. These rules were established at a time when diversity in newsrooms was not nearly as prominent of an issue as it is now and when journalists did not have social media accounts. Now that Donald Trump is president and now that the issue of diversity in newsrooms is on everyone’s mind, we want to look at the future of these codes and explore how journalists who identify as minorities can use self-care to navigate the tension between identity and ethics. What does it mean to be an immigrant in a newsroom when the president has based much of his campaign on anti-immigrant sentiments? How does a transgender reporter take personal politics out of their job when legislative steps are encroaching on their everyday rights? In this session, we present and discuss codes of conduct from various newsrooms before splitting up into groups and writing one together, one that will take into account the reality of modern journalism. https://work.srccon.org/sessions/#proposal-8
